# Changes

The mod has better keybinds that don't conflict when multiple debug options are used together, more convenient camera settings for video recording and overlay text showing all the available functions.

The `src` folder contains mostly code that i've added/altered to make the mod possible. The three dots indicate sections of code that i've decided to remove since I can't redistribute the entire codebase.
