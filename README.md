# Changes

The mod has better keybinds that don't conflict when multiple debug options are used together, more convenient camera settings for video recording and overlay text showing all the available functions.

## TODO:

- Finish readme
- Update patch file for first release
- Upload first release DLL
- Force FOV when toggling camera on
