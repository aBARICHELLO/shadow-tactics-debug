# Changes

The mod has better keybinds that don't conflict when multiple debug options are used together, more convenient camera settings for video recording and overlay text showing all the available functions.

# Notes about the game

The 'When Cut Across the Neck' achievement can be obtained by shooting Noboru with your matchlock pistol (when using the teleport) instead of making the soldier misfire.
More dev options are available for spawning/killing/teleporting but they are undocumented, check the game's source code for the rest.

## Character development names:

Hayato - Ninja
Yuki - Trapper
Mugen - Warrior
Ayko - Geisha
Takuma - Alchemist

# License

The `src` folder contains the code that I've added/altered to make the mod possible. The three dots indicate sections of code that I decided to remove since I can't redistribute the codebase.
